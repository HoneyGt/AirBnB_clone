AirBnB clone - Web static
=========================

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

* Create simple HTML static pages
* Style guide
* Fake contents
* No Javascript
* No data loaded from anything

HTML is the structure of the page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of the page, the design.
